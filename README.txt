=============================== HOW TO RUN THE GAME ==============================

- The game can be run by opening DiceWars.jar.

- At least Java Version 17 is needed to run the game.

- If, for whatever reason, the .jar executable doesn't work, the game can also be played by running "DiceWars.java" from the "src/dice_wars" folder 
(NOTE: the file should be run after opening VSCode in the parent folder "Dice Wars", so it can access the assets).

=================================== HOW TO PLAY ===================================

Press the "Vs. Computer" button to play the game against an AI. A map will be generated randomly, shown in a grid-like pattern.
The scores on the left and right represent the number of territories of each side. The player-controlled territories are shown in purple, 
while the computer-controlled ones are green. Before the game starts, the player can "reroll" the map by clicking on the button at the top of the screen.

Each cell of the grid has a number assigned to it. These numbers symbolize dice. When a territory (A) attacks an opposing territory (B),
a number of dice equal to the number on each of those territories get rolled. The sum of the rolled dice get compared against each other.
If the value of territory A is higher than that of territory B, then the latter is captured by A and every die except one moves over to the newly captured territory.
If the value is equal or lower, then territory A loses all of its dice except one. A territory can only attack if it has more than one die.

The game consists of turns that alternate between the player and the computer. The first turn is chosen randomly. On their turn, the 
player can chose any territory and attack a neighbouring enemy territory. If the same cell is clicked again, the attack state can be cancelled. 
At any point, the player can end their turn. Then the computer will take its turn and so on until one side wins by controlling every single territory. 
At the end of every turn, a number of dice equal to the number of territories controlled by that whoever ended their turn are randomly assigned to their controlled territories.
